19th January 2007 was a black day. Journalist
[Hrant Dink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrant_dink) was assassinated by a
Turkish nationalist. Hrant was a brave man who refused to remain silent despite
threats on his life. Today - after four years - the pain is still fresh. The
anger towards fascism and the will to *escape from our stinking black-minded
ignorance* keeps growing.

Just like other intellectuals of this land whose lives were taken away -
[Ahmet Taner Kışlalı](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmet_Taner_K%C4%B1%C5%9Flal%C4%B1),
[Bahriye Üçok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahriye_%C3%9C%C3%A7ok) and
[Uğur Mumcu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U%C4%9Fur_Mumcu) to name a few -
he has a place in our hearts. Their ideas and thoughts shed light on our path to
peace.
