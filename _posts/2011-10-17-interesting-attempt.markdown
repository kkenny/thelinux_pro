Merhaba,

Serbest çağrışımlarımızı anadilimiz olmayan bir dilde anlatmaya çalışmak
ne kadar farklıdır? Benim için değişik bir tecrübeydi, paylaşmak
istedim.

Greetings to non-Turkish readers,

How different is it to explain our free associations in a non-native
language? It was a different experience for me, which I'd like to share.

> ## The Wall
> 
> The theory that my "other" personality might be an English speaker made
> me give this a try. As I took another sip from my tea, this room felt a
> bit different. Different in such a way that is enabling me to let my
> subconsciousness take over.
> 
> Staring at the wall against me, I realized how it started to turn into a
> door. A door, made of small curved mirrors... All the paintings on the
> wall faded away slowly. There I was, left alone with a door to enter.
> Was this a question of bravery? I was astonished to dream where the door
> might lead me to. "Temptation, temptation..." So I heard the voices
> sing. I must admit, I felt kind of scared. Like a baby felt giving birth
> to her first mother. Feeling I might change my mind, I quickly grabbed
> my book and opened the door. I was expecting a forest, green and huge.
> Quite the contrary, the door led me to another room with mirrors on all
> of its walls, ceiling and base. I could see the reflection of everything
> but myself. The door was no longer there and my book looked a lot
> different to me. What was I about to do here? What exactly did I leave
> behind? The lack of which made me smile like a mother smiled giving
> birth to her own mother...
> 
> Leaving my book in a corner of the room, I started observing the
> mirrors. Why was my reflection not there? In a room like that, how could
> I figure out the difference this journey might have caused? After a
> couple of minutes, I was shocked when I started to wonder why I couldn't
> see the reflections of the things that "touch" me, unlike all the other
> things in the room. My clothes, my shoes, my earring... All became
> visible as I took them off. "The book!", I said, "where is it?" turning
> to the corner where I left it. Its reflection was there though. Looking
> at me and smiling like my mother smiled, giving birth to my
> grandmother...
> 
> Somehow, I knew the cure was in this room but where? The endlessness,
> which the mirrors have formed, gave me an idea. Why was I thinking that
> the other side of the mirror was inaccessible to me? "Temptation,
> temptation..." So I heard the voices sing. I must admit, I felt kind of
> scared. Like a warrior felt, being slain by his new-born baby... Feeling
> I might have found the cure, I took a step into the mirror. There I saw
> my "other" self sitting in that room, looking at the wall, writing a
> truly weird story... I can't say he was astonished though, seeing me
> standing against him, naked.
