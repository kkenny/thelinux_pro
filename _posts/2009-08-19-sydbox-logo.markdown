As **$title** says [sydbox]({{site.url}}/sydbox/) needs a
[logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo). We discussed this today in
[#exherbo](irc://irc.freenode.net/exherbo) and some good ideas came up.  
I added a **logo** section to our
[TODO](http://github.com/alip/sydbox/blob/master/TODO.mkd) writing down these
ideas so they aren't forgotten.

Vector format, ideally [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg), is preferred.
