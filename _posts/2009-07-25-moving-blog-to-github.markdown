I've been blogging on [wordpress](http://polatel.wordpress.com/) for a while now.  
I must say I wasn't happy with a lot of things.  
First of all you have to write plain html not something cool like
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  
You can't use your favourite text editor to write blog entries either.  
Unless, of course, you're using the cool
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) add-on
[it's all text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125), but that's
not very practical either.

Blogging on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) has a lot of advantages.  
The nicest of them all is you keep your whole blog in a
[git](http://www.git-scm.org/) repository.  
You can use [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to write
blog entries which is a whole way ahead of writing html.  
[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master) makes managing the blog real fun.
