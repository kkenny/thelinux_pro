Writing with the intention to grow up:

**Rule 1**: Stay out of the magical world. This your subconscious speaking.

**Rule 2**: Never underestimate the power of goats.

**Rule 3**: Pink Floyd after midnight is easy on the eyes.

**Rule ?**: Numbers are bad.

**Rule**: Actually they have no reason whatsoever to even exist.

**?**: No rule, no pain.

**Love**: You are on the right path, Watson.

Do not define `sizeof(void *)`. Because in what you would call a primitive
world you would only need love, pure, endless love.

Ooomray!

Now look at the sky, look at the river. Isn't it good?

If not, return to **rule 3**.
