[taginfo](http://freshmeat.net/projects/taginfo) is a useful audio tag reader
that can be used in shell scripts.  
The bad thing is it can't set tags so until now I had to use
[audiotag](http://www.tempestgames.com/ryan) to set the tags in my shell
scripts.

Today I've written a simple tool called
[envtag](http://github.com/alip/envtag/tree/master) while experimenting with
taglib's C bindings.  
It's a lot like taginfo and adds a -s option to set the tags from environment
variables.  
The [README](http://github.com/alip/envtag/blob/master/README.mkd) is here if you
are interested.
