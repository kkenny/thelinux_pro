Sydbox-0.1\_beta has been released.  
- Fix bogus access violations.  
  As an example sydbox would throw an access violation in a simple case like:

    mkdir -p /var/tmp/paludis
  because of mkdir(”/var”, …) being called. This is now fixed.  
- Use glib's key file format for configuration file. This kills the dependency  
  on dev-libs/confuse. Being a crucial system tool we’re trying to keep the  
  dependencies as few as possible.
