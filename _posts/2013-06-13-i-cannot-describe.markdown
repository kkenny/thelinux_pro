As the [Garip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garip) poet
[Orhan Veli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orhan_Veli) once wrote,

    Can you hear me if I cry,
    In my verses;
    Can you touch,
    My tears, with your hands?

    I hadn't known how songs were so lovely,
    And yet the words so inadequate
    Before I had fallen into this suffering.

    I know there is somewhere
    To say anything about which is possible;
    I am very close, I can hear;
    I can not tell...

in his poem *Anlatamıyorum* (*I Can Not Tell*, translated by [myself]({{site.url}}) on 2013-06-13).
Sometimes a photo may describe what we can't describe with a thousand words.

![You know your government has failed, when your grandma starts to riot!]({{site.url}}/images/direnbayan.png "You know your government has failed, when your grandma starts to riot!")

Long story short, **you know your government has failed, when your grandma starts
to riot...**

Occupy Gezi! *Diren Gezi!*
