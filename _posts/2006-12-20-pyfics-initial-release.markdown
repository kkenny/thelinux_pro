Today I released pyfics-0.01\_alpha. PyFics is a [Python](http://www.python.org)
library to communicate to [FICS](http://www.freechess.org),  
which will hopefully make it easy to write bots and interfaces with Python.  
It's the initial release and still needs some work.  
The project page is [here](http://pyfics.sourceforge.net).
