sydbox-0.1\_alpha is released.  
This is the initial release of sydbox.

#### What is sydbox? ####
Sydbox is a [ptrace](http://linux.die.net/man/2/ptrace) based sandbox
implementation which is based in part upon
[catbox](http://svn.pardus.org.tr/uludag/trunk/python-modules/catbox/) and
[strace](http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace).  
Being ptrace based, it doesn't suffer from the well known security issues that  
__LD\_PRELOAD__ based sandbox implementations suffer from.  
It has basic support to disallow network connections.

#### OS/Arch Support ####
At the moment only supported operating system is Linux and only supported
architectures are x86 and x86\_64  
but adding support for new architectures should be trivial.  
If youâ€™re interested in porting please send a mail to me or leave a comment to this post.
