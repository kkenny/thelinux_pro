sydbox-0.2\_alpha is released.

* Wait for all children to exit by default. This can be unset using the command
  line option -X or the magic command `wait/eldest`.
* Let the children continue their execution by calling
  `ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, ...)` instead of attempting to kill them during exit for
  `wait/eldest` mode.
