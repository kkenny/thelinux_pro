Sydbox-0.1\_beta8 is released.

- Exit when eldest child exits and add a command line flag --wait-all to wait for  
  all children before exiting.
- Fix /proc/self substitution.
- Add configuration file variable main.allow\_proc\_pid and allow /proc/PID  
  depending on that variable. This defaults to true because allowing /proc/PID  
  is required for some programs to work reliably.
- Path sandboxing can now be disabled using the configuration file or  
  --disable-sandbox-path command line option. Previously this was only possible  
  using /dev/sydbox/{on,off} magic commands.
- Configuration file changes, make sure to merge your configuration file.
