After [announcing](/english/2009/08/19/sydbox-logo.html) that we need a logo,
two responses came.

The first design is by [David Shakaryan](http://omp.am/) aka <tt>omp</tt>. The
design uses spbecker's idea which was the cover of
[dark side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon),
except with some representation of a box substituted for the prism. After
talking in [#sydbox](irc://irc.freenode.net/sydbox) he decided to add a
[Siamese cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_%28cat%29) on top of the box making
the logo even nicer.

The second design is by Sterling X. Winter aka <tt>replica</tt>. It's a simple
design featuring a
[Hexagram 24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_hexagrams#Hexagram24).
Quoting from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org):

    Hexagram 24 is named 復 (fù), "Returning". Other variations include "return (the
    turning point)". Its inner trigram is ☳ (震 zhèn) shake = (雷) thunder, and its
    outer trigram is ☷ (坤 kūn) field = (地) earth.

Of course this reminds me of the
[Chapter 24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_24) song by
[Pink Floyd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_floyd) which goes like:

    ...
    Change returns success
    Going and coming without error
    Action brings good fortune
    ...

Both of these logos are really nice and I couldn't choose one.  
I started a
[survey](http://www.survs.com/survey?id=TUN3T95O&channel=CJF449ZVOA) so that
[Exherbo](http://www.exherbo.org) users can choose which one they like best.

I'll be very happy if you can be kind enough to participate in this
[survey](http://www.survs.com/survey?id=TUN3T95O&channel=CJF449ZVOA).
Thanks in advance!
