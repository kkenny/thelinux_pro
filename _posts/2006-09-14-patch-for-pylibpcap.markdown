Today I wrote a patch for pylibpcap to work with swig-1.3.29.  
Basically pylibpcap has been tested with swig-1.3.27 and pcap.i files generated by  
swig-1.3.27 and swig-1.3.29 are different.  
So the regex in _build-tools/docify-shadow.py_ doesn't match.  
The patch is [here](/code/patches/pylibpcap-swig-1.3.29.patch).
